# Invasion

Hi! If you're reading this, I assume you're a Hypixel employee reviewing my portfolio...

If so, please note the following:

- This is a much older project of mine (built when I was in early high school), meant to act as a contrast against Capture the Flag. I don't stand by
a lot of the coding practice employed here, as aspects of it are certainly amatuer, although the game does function if compiled (though its progression is incomplete).
I'd ask that you less read in solely to how this code is written, and more how much CTF's code is superior in comparison to it, so as to demonstrate not only use of
and experience with Java over several years, but also significant improvement.
- If you're reading the enchantments and enchantment system and wondering, yes, I took lots of inspiration from The Pit. I was fascinated with the custom
enchantment system and wanted to see if I could make my own.

With all of that said, feel free to take a gander through the project!
